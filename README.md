## 📌 Project Overview
OptApply is a free, centralized platform designed to help job seekers efficiently manage applications, interviews, and deadlines. By integrating with job boards, automatically categorizing application statuses, and providing a built-in calendar feature, it eliminates the stress of manual tracking and ensures users stay organized. Ideal for college students, career changers, and busy professionals, this tool simplifies the job search process, preventing missed deadlines, forgotten interviews, and duplicate applications, ultimately making job hunting more seamless and efficient.

## 🏃 Run Instructions
To run OptApply locally, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.

2. **Install dependencies and start the development server**:

   npm install
   npm run dev

4. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 🔐 Logging In

You have two options to access the application:

- **Use the mock admin account**:
  - **Email**: `admin@example.com`  
  - **Password**: `adminpass`

- **Create your own account** within the app.

> ⚠️ **Note**: If you create your own account, it is stored **only in memory**. This means:
> - Your login will **not persist** after refreshing the page.
> - You’ll need to either sign up again or use the mock admin account to log back in.
